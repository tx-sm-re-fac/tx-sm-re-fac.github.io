      <h2>Welcome to the Texas Smith Mountains Research Facility</h2>
      <p>
        Operated under the Department of Ecological Anomalies, our team is committed to studying the unique biodiversity of the Smith Mountains, located just east of Houston, Texas.

        Our work has led to the discovery of several previously undocumented species, including the <strong>Crawlbag</strong>, <strong>Hole-eyed</strong>, and others currently under restricted classification.
