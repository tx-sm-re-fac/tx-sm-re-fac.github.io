    <h2>About the Facility</h2>
    <p>
      Hidden within the rugged expanse of the Smith Mountains lies the TSMRF â€” a government-funded, privately-managed research facility specializing in the study of anomalous lifeforms and unexplained phenomena. Established in the late 1970s under mysterious circumstances, the facility's true purpose remained classified for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the Texas Smith Mountains Research Facility operates with a dual mission: containment and understanding. Our team of dedicated researchers, biologists, field agents, and containment specialists work around the clock to document, categorize, and learn from the strange entities that inhabit the Smith range.
    </p>
    <p>
      While most of our findings remain highly classified, some select information has been made public for educational purposes. Our "Creatures" page is one such resource, offering a glimpse into the unsettling ecosystem that thrives just beyond the borders of everyday reality.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Declassified reports suggest that TSMRF was first founded after a series of strange disappearances in the area, followed by sightings of creatures with no known biological lineage. Initially a military outpost, the site quickly evolved into a research station when physical evidence of these anomalies could no longer be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, TSMRF has adapted to each new discovery, expanding its database, upgrading containment technology, and refining protocols. Still, with each answer uncovered... new questions take its place.
